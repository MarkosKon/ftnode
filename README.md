# Font tools node

A script that runs a list of font files through `varLib.instancer` and/or `pyftsubset`. See the [help menu](help.txt).

## Dependencies

`varLib.instancer` and `pyftsubset` are part of the python package `fonttools`, and for this script to work, you need to install them with `pip install fonttools Brotli` (Brotli is required by the fontttools).

I'm also using `zx` to simplify working with child processes in Node, so you'll need to install it with `npm i -g zx`.

Needless to say that you need Python and Node to install the dependencies mentioned above.

## How to run

`npm i -g ftnode`

## How to use

See the [the help menu generated by yargs](help.txt) or run the program with the `--help` option.
